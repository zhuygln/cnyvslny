      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-8">A Documentary Timeline from Hong Kong's Colonial Records &middot; January 20, 2026</p>

      <p class="mb-4">In recent years, public institutions, corporations, and governments have alternated between the terms <strong>"Chinese New Year"</strong> and <strong>"Lunar New Year."</strong> Rather than approaching this as a cultural or political debate, this post looks at <em>archival English‑language primary sources</em> to trace how official terminology changed over time.</p>
      <p class="mb-6">The question is simple:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-text-muted mb-8">What do official documents actually say?</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">This case study focuses on British Hong Kong, where public holidays were codified in ordinance and regularly amended. The result is a clear paper trail showing when "Chinese New Year" was used in law and when it was replaced by "Lunar New Year."</p>

      <!-- 1. 1875 -->
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">1. 1875 — "Chinese New Year's Day" in Colonial Law</h2>
      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-4"><strong>Source:</strong> <em>Public Holidays Ordinance, No. 2 of 1875</em> (Hong Kong Government Gazette; now on Hong Kong e‑Legislation as historical law).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">The Second Schedule of the 1875 ordinance lists bank holidays and includes an entry explicitly named:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-text-muted mb-4">"chinese new year's day."</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">In other words, in late 19th‑century British colonial legal language, the official English term for the festival was <strong>"Chinese New Year's Day."</strong> The phrase "Lunar New Year" does <em>not</em> appear anywhere in this ordinance.</p>

      <!-- 2. 1912 -->
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">2. 1912 — Continued Legal Usage of "Chinese New Year"</h2>
      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-4"><strong>Source:</strong> <em>Holidays Ordinance, No. 5 of 1912</em> (Hong Kong Government Gazette; consolidated later into Cap. 149 General Holidays Ordinance).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">When Hong Kong revised its holidays legislation in 1912, the wording <strong>continued</strong> to refer to:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-text-muted mb-4">"Chinese New Year's Day."</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">By the early 20th century, the formal legal wording remained unchanged, reinforcing that "Chinese New Year" was the standard English term in colonial statutory language for this holiday.</p>

      <!-- 3. 1967 -->
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">3. 1967 — "Chinese New Year" Still in Force</h2>
      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-4"><strong>Source:</strong> <em>Holidays (Amendment) Ordinance, No. 19 of 1967</em> (amending the holidays framework that later became Cap. 149).</p>
      <p class="mb-4">On the eve of the 1968 change, Hong Kong law still referred to the holiday explicitly as:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 text-text-muted">
        <li>"Chinese New Year's Day"</li>
        <li>"the second day of Chinese New Year"</li>
        <li>"the third day of Chinese New Year"</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">Up to and including the 1967 amendment, the <strong>codified legal terminology</strong> in Hong Kong remained consistently "Chinese New Year," not "Lunar New Year."</p>

      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-4"><strong>Key Source (Bill):</strong> <em>Holidays (Amendment) Bill 1968</em> — Bill No. 11 of 1968, published in <strong>Legal Supplement No. 3 to the Hong Kong Government Gazette</strong> on 11 April 1968.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">In this 1968 amendment, the holiday names were <strong>formally rewritten</strong>. Where earlier ordinances had spoken of "Chinese New Year's Day," the amendment introduced:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 text-text-muted">
        <li>"Lunar New Year's Day"</li>
        <li>"the second day of Lunar New Year"</li>
        <li>"the third day of Lunar New Year"</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">This is the earliest <strong>clear, traceable</strong> change in <em>legal</em> terminology from "Chinese New Year" to "Lunar New Year" in Hong Kong's English‑language statutes.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">A parallel change appears in labour law.</p>
      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-4"><strong>Source:</strong> <em>Industrial Employment (Holidays with Pay and Sickness Allowance) (Amendment) Bill 1968</em>, Bill No. 12 of 1968, also in Legal Supplement No. 3 (11 April 1968).</p>

      <p class="mb-4">In the "Objects and Reasons" section, the Bill explicitly states:</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-text-muted mb-4">"The Bill also substitutes references to <strong>Lunar New Year's Day</strong> for existing references in the Ordinance to <strong>Chinese New Year's Day</strong>, to accord with a similar amendment to the Holidays Ordinance."</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">This sentence directly confirms that:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mb-4 space-y-2 text-text-muted">
        <li>"Chinese New Year's Day" was the old statutory term.</li>
        <li>"Lunar New Year's Day" was intentionally introduced as a replacement in 1968.</li>
        <li>The drafters themselves saw this as a coordinated change across multiple ordinances.</li>

      <p class="mb-4">In the debate on the <em>Holidays (Amendment) Bill 1968</em>, the government explains the reasoning behind the amendments, including the move from "Chinese New Year" phrasing to "Lunar New Year." This debate can be cited or reproduced as an additional figure to show how officials presented the change at the time.</p>

      <!-- 7. Early Journalism -->
      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">7. Early English Journalism — "Lunar New Year" Before 1968</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Outside the law, English‑language newspapers had already experimented with broader terminology.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1 text-text-muted">
        <li>Early 20th‑century papers such as the <em>North‑China Herald</em> used phrases like "Lunar New Year festivities" and "Spring Festival" alongside "Chinese New Year."</li>
        <li>This shows that <strong>"Lunar New Year"</strong> existed in English journalism <em>before</em> 1968, but did not replace "Chinese New Year" in Hong Kong's statutes until that year.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">In short, journalistic usage was <strong>mixed</strong>, while legal usage in Hong Kong followed a clear sequence: "Chinese New Year" (1875–1967) → "Lunar New Year" (from 1968).</p>

      <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2 text-text-muted">
        <li>"Chinese New Year" was the dominant <em>official legal</em> term in Hong Kong from at least 1875 through 1967.</li>
        <li>"Lunar New Year" appears in English‑language newspapers earlier, but only enters Hong Kong <strong>legislation</strong> in 1968.</li>
        <li>The 1968 Bills and Ordinance, preserved today on Hong Kong e‑Legislation and in the Government Gazette, provide a clean documentary pivot point from one term to the other.</li>
        <li>Terminology has therefore <strong>evolved over time</strong> rather than being fixed, with legal, political, and cultural factors shaping which label appears in which context.</li>
