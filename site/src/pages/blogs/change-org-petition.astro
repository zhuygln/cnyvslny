      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-8">February 19, 2026 &middot; Petition by Alice Meng</p>

      <p class="mb-4">A Change.org petition launched by <strong>Alice Meng</strong> calls on governments and institutions to stop replacing "Chinese New Year" with "Lunar New Year," framing the rebrand as cultural erasure with roots in colonial history.</p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Overview</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The petition argues that the growing replacement of "Chinese New Year" with "Lunar New Year" reflects a broader pattern of cultural erasure rooted in colonial history and modern misrepresentation. The festival originates from the Chinese <strong>luni-solar</strong> calendar — not a purely lunar system — making the generic label factually inaccurate as well as culturally diminishing.</p>
      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-accent pl-4 italic text-text-muted mb-4">Rebranding it as "Lunar New Year" strips the celebration of its historical identity, weakens recognition of Chinese-originated cultural heritage, and risks turning a deeply rooted tradition into a vague event.</blockquote>
      <p class="mb-4">The petition also notes that in December 2024, "Chinese New Year" (Chunjie / Spring Festival) was formally recognised by UNESCO as intangible cultural heritage, reinforcing the case for using the original name.</p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Key Arguments</h2>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-3">1. The term "Lunar New Year" carries a colonial legacy</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The petition traces the terminology shift to British colonial Hong Kong. The <em>Holidays (Amendment) Ordinance No. 19 of 1967</em> used "Chinese New Year," while the <em>Holidays (Amendment) Ordinance 1968 (Bill No. 11 of 1968)</em>, published on 11 April 1968, replaced it with "Lunar New Year" for the first time. The petition argues that reinstating "Chinese New Year" aligns with broader global efforts toward decolonisation.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-3">2. Rebranding as "Lunar New Year" is factually inaccurate</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The traditional Chinese calendar is <strong>luni-solar</strong>, incorporating both lunar phases and the solar year. The Chinese Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO) in Nanjing determines the official date using precise astronomical calculations. By contrast, the Islamic Hijri Calendar is a true lunar calendar. Conflating the two systems misrepresents the astronomical principles underlying each tradition.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-3">3. Respecting cultural origin matters</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">The petition draws an analogy: just as the language spoken in the Anglophone world is called "English" to acknowledge its origins, using "Chinese New Year" recognises where the festival came from — without excluding other communities that celebrate it. The 2024 UNESCO recognition of Chunjie as intangible cultural heritage further reinforces using terminology that reflects the festival's origin.</p>

      <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mt-8 mb-3">4. Inclusivity should not come at the cost of cultural appropriation</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">While the petition acknowledges the intention behind more inclusive terminology, it argues that genuine inclusivity respects historical and cultural origins rather than erasing them. Using "Chinese New Year" does not prevent others from participating in or celebrating the festival.</p>

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Connection to This Project</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The petition's argument about the 1967–1968 terminology shift in Hong Kong colonial law directly mirrors the documentary evidence presented on our <a href={`${base}history`} class="text-accent-light hover:underline">History</a> page, which traces the same change through primary legal sources. This petition demonstrates growing public awareness of — and engagement with — the historical record.</p>
