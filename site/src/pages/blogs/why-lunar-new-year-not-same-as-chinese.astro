      <p class="text-text-muted text-sm mb-8">January 28, 2025 &middot; By <strong>Isabel Zhang 張</strong> &middot; <a href={originalUrl} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-accent-light hover:underline">Original post on LinkedIn</a></p>

      <p class="mb-4">As we approach one of the biggest festivals in the world, it is vital to reflect on how we, as a society, recognise and honour cultural traditions.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The shift in terminology from "Chinese New Year" to "Lunar New Year" has sparked significant global debate in recent years, particularly within Chinese Australian communities. This conversation is especially relevant in Australia, where we are geographically close to Asia and home to a significant population of first-generation migrants from Mainland China. While this change in terminology might be seen as an attempt to be inclusive, it has also led to backlash and concerns about cultural appropriation, as well as the risks of imposing a top-down approach that could dilute the authenticity of deeply rooted traditions.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">In an insightful interview with <strong>Mark Wang</strong>, CEO of the Museum of Chinese Australian History and a fifth-generation Chinese Australian, he highlights how the Spring Festival, or Chūnjié, has been celebrated for over 3,000 years. Mark explains that this festival, originating in agrarian societies, symbolises the renewal of life and carries immense historical and cultural significance. It is much more than a lunar event; it is a celebration intrinsically tied to Chinese identity, heritage, and history.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">The term "Lunar New Year" attempts to unify several New Year celebrations under one label, yet in doing so, it overlooks the distinctiveness of each tradition. Vietnamese communities celebrate Tết, Korean communities celebrate Seollal, and many other cultures have their own New Year customs, all tied to unique evolution of histories, identities, and cultural practices. By grouping them all under the term "Lunar New Year," we risk erasing the individuality of each tradition, reducing them to a homogenised concept that fails to honour their respective cultural nuances.</p>

      <p class="mb-6">As a cultural expert, I see this shift in terminology as problematic for several reasons:</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">1. Cultural Misrepresentation</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">The term "Lunar New Year" does not accurately reflect the festival's significance for Chinese communities. The Chinese calendar is lunisolar, combining both lunar and solar cycles, which further distinguishes it from other purely lunar traditions. The customs, rituals, and historical meanings of the Spring Festival are uniquely Chinese and cannot be fully captured by a generic term like "Lunar New Year."</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Moreover, "Lunar New Year" does not align with how Chinese people themselves refer to the festival. In Mainland China, it is called Chūnjié (Spring Festival) in Mandarin or more recently 農曆新年 only when explicitly distinguishing it from the Gregorian calendar.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Using the incorrect label reduces its cultural specificity, unintentionally obscuring its essence.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">2. Top-Down Imposition</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">The shift in terminology often originates from external organisations or policymakers rather than from within the communities directly impacted. Mark Wang emphasises that inclusivity in cultural activities should involve encouraging broader participation while respecting the authenticity of cultural expressions. However, the term "Lunar New Year" appears to have been imposed without meaningful consultation with Chinese communities, creating a sense of cultural misrepresentation and frustration.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">This approach risks alienating communities by presenting inclusivity as a one-size-fits-all solution. Inclusivity does not mean uniformity; it means recognising and respecting the uniqueness of different cultures.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">3. Threat to Cultural Identity</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">For first- and second-generation Chinese Australians, the Spring Festival is not just a celebration; it is a lifeline to their heritage and history. This festival connects families and communities across continents, reaffirming a shared identity.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">When institutions rename the celebration without the input of those who hold it dear, it risks alienating younger generations from their cultural roots. By calling it "Lunar New Year," we inadvertently dilute the identity it represents, diminishing the sense of pride and connection tied to the festival.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">4. Chinese as More Than a Nationality</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">One of the most overlooked aspects of this debate is the misconception that "Chinese" solely denotes nationality. The term encompasses much more — Chinese is culture, is language, is heritage, is race, and ethnicity.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Being Chinese is not confined to the borders of the People's Republic of China; it includes the global diaspora who have carried their traditions to every corner of the world. From Malaysian Chinese communities celebrating the Spring Festival with lion dances to Canadian Chinese families making dumplings together, the festival is a global expression of shared culture.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">By reducing "Chinese New Year" to "Lunar New Year," we risk erasing the depth and complexity of what it means to be Chinese. This terminology inadvertently diminishes the legacy of Chinese culture, which has thrived across centuries and continents.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">5. Origins of the Term</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">It is worth noting that both "Chinese New Year" and "Lunar New Year" are terms coined by non-native speakers. These labels were introduced to make the festival more accessible to English-speaking audiences. However, as we have seen with other cultural celebrations like Diwali or Hari Raya, there is a growing acceptance of using original, phonetically accurate names.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Perhaps it is time to embrace the authentic term Chūnjié (Spring Festival) or its equivalents in other Chinese dialects, just as we honour the names of other global traditions. Using culturally specific terminology demonstrates respect for the origin and meaning of the festival.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">6. Political Implications</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">The shift from "Chinese New Year" to "Lunar New Year" carries political undertones, whether intentional or not. It reflects broader geopolitical tensions and an effort to depoliticise the Chinese identity. However, in attempting to neutralise the terminology, we risk politicising the tradition further.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">By sidelining the Chinese origins of the festival, we unintentionally reinforce narratives that seek to downplay the contributions and presence of Chinese communities globally. This not only undermines the significance of the festival but also risks marginalising the people who celebrate it.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">7. Need for Community Education</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">Even within Chinese communities in Commonwealth countries like Australia, Canada, and the UK, there is a growing need for education on this issue. Many individuals adopt "Lunar New Year," believing it to be politically correct or trendy, without fully understanding the historical and cultural implications of the terminology.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">This trend highlights the need to reconnect with the true essence of the Spring Festival and educate younger generations about its deep cultural roots. As Mark Wang notes, awareness and education are key to preserving cultural traditions in a rapidly globalising world.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">The Power of Language</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">Language is powerful. It shapes how we perceive and connect with the world. By listening to the voices of communities who celebrate these traditions, we can ensure that our efforts to promote inclusivity do not come at the expense of cultural recognition.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Just as we respect and honour the unique names of Diwali, Songkran, and Eid, we should strive to do the same for the Spring Festival. Referring to it as Chūnjié or "Chinese New Year" reinforces its identity, history, and connection to Chinese culture.</p>

      <hr class="border-[rgba(240,230,255,0.1)] my-10" />

      <h2 class="font-serif text-2xl font-bold mt-10 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>

      <p class="mb-4">As we continue to embrace multiculturalism, it is important to honour traditions authentically rather than dilute them in the name of inclusivity. The Spring Festival is a celebration of renewal, family, and history that has been carried across centuries and continents by Chinese communities around the world.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">By recognising its true name and meaning, we not only preserve the cultural heritage of Chinese Australians but also foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of the diverse cultures that make up our global community. Inclusivity is not about erasing differences; it is about celebrating them.</p>

      <p class="mb-4">Let us approach this season with respect and curiosity, celebrating the Spring Festival for what it truly is: one of the world's most vibrant and enduring cultural traditions.</p>
